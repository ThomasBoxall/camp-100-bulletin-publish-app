# Camp 100 Digital Bulletin System

WIP.

## To do

* make it more robust, ie error handling
* emails on publish
* Add priority of content (ie 1 2 3) and then the data gets sorted in that order
* Manual publish? 
* Show before, show after on content? 
* better logging naming structure?


## Deployment Notes
* Within WordPress
  * set the default post category to be 'bulletin' - can't set this by code on create request
  * disable comments on new posts - can't set this by code on create request
